# kkmnow-front

This is the data repo for KKMNOW. Note that this contains highly processed data intended for use by [`kkmnow-back`](https://github.com/MoH-Malaysia/kkmnow-back) rather than for members of the public to download and play with. Consequently, although this repo is open, we do not accept contributions (but are happy to fix any issues). 

Note that you do not need to clone the repo locally in order to serve your API - the backend code pulls directly from the latest version of this repo.
